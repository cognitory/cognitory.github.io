# Build Your Dream App

We (Raf and James) are starting up a learning experience to help our friends (and friends of friends) to build that-app-they've-been-thinking-of-building-for-like-foreverrrr. Developing apps isn't easy, but with the right tools and direction, you can avoid a lot of pain. Plus, it's a ton of fun. ...and, you don't need to shell out big bucks to have someone else do it for you and be forever beholden to them for changes.

## Our Goal:

To teach you how to develop serious web applications in the least amount of time.


## Not Our Goal:

To prepare you for a web app development job (we will gloss over details that a professional developer should know)


## What to Expect:

### at-your-own-pace online exercises and resources that will guide you through developing web apps in Clojure

(no lectures! ...but maybe some videos)

### a collaborative wiki

w/ tl;drs of concepts and links to external resources... which we expect you to edit

### weekly in-person support sessions (place and time TBD)

James and Raf will be around to help you with problems you run into and to correct any misconceptions that may be blocking your progress

### an online community for peer-to-peer support throughout the week


## What we Expect of You:

 - Curiosity -- programming is really a lot about experimenting, exploring, solving problems and trying things
 - Patience -- when learning to program and develop for the web, you have to be willing to keep trying and not give up.
 - Feedback -- we want this experience to be awesome, please let us know any way we can do better
 - Collaboration -- helping others and explaining concepts to someone else is one of the best ways for you to learn


## A few other notes:

### "Web Apps" not "Websites"

Websites are mostly static (think: company pages, brochure sites) and just require a knowledge of HTML and CSS.
Web apps are interactive (think: wikipedia, facebook, google, slack) and require a knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Servers and Databases.

### "Web Apps" not "Mobile Apps"

Web apps can run in anything that has a browser -- your laptop, your tablet, your phone, your tv, maybe even your fridge. Mac or Windows, iOS or Android -- whatever... if it has a browser, a web app can get there. ...and, you can even package your web app as a native app for mobile and desktop (for example, the Slack iOS and desktop apps are actually web apps!) It's also faster to build web apps (and to change and update them). We've built mobile apps before, and we think that in most cases, it's best to start with web first, then maybe build a native app when you have the $$$$.

### "Clojure" not "Javascript"

If you were to ask a random web app developer what language they use for web development, they'll probably say Javascript. ...and yet, we'll be teaching you Clojure. What gives? We feel that Clojure is an easier language to learn, easier to express ideas with, has great libraries and tools, and has a welcoming community. It's not as popular as some other languages, but... remember... our point is to get you building an awesome web app, not to get you a job (although, knowing Clojure will likely get you a job faster than knowing JS... but I digress...) We've worked with lot of languages, including many years with Javascript, but we've settled on Clojure (and use it 100% for everything we do for our projects) because we think it's the best tool for the job.


## FAQ

### Is it OK if I have no programming experience?

Yep. It will be harder and you should expect to go slower than those with some experience, but we're up for the challenge if you are. You will learn to code by building simple and then increasingly complex web apps, which we think is much more fun than learning to code as its own thing.


### Can I participate remotely?

Yep! (The help sessions will probably be a little rocky at first, but the plan is to help via Screenhero)


### Do I need to attend every session?

Nope.


### Who are you?

Your mentors will be Rafal Dittwald and James Cash. We have been programming for 15 years, developing for the web for at least 10, and working together for 5. We are full-time web developers and entrepreneurs and have designed and developed hundreds of web apps, websites and mobile apps over the years, both for clients and our own products. We teach web and iOS development at a developer-bootcamp/college (but this experience will be very different -- and it won't cost you $8,500).


### Will this cost me anything?

This is the first time we're doing this, the content will be untested, and you'll be doing most of the work ("learning is something you do, not something that is done to you"). You are all in a different situation, so we'll let you decide what the experience is worth to you. The plan is: Pay What You Want at each session. We'll have an anonymous box.
